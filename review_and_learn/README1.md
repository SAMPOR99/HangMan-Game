# welcome 

#### this is the learning section, here you will find a lot of topics that will help me to build this game and other stuff like improving my english and technical writting.

#### I must emphasize that I'm just a beginner with the desire to improve myself by test and error, so this section at least at the outset is going to be more like a draft than a technical writting however that does not mean that while we are moving forward, we cannot modify that in order to appear more technical, of course we will.

#### each topic will be distributed in different directories in order to aiming to a better understanding of the topics.
