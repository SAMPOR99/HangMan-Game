# what is technical writting

#### this is a summary according to what I read a few hours ago.

#### technical writting is about not just documentation and boring stuff but about explaining in a way that everyone can understand and interpret, here you will find ideas, complex processes, concepts, and technical information that are going to help you how to use properly industrial equipment, prevent accidents, how to evaluate medical conditions, how to use an app and much more.

#### among the people who apply technical writting, we can encounter different soft skills like communication, fast learning, neat writting not only in their native language but in english as well, and explaining complex technologies to the public target, also they have hard skills they comprehend coding in programming languages.

#### so you can say that a technical writter is like a weird hybrid talent person who combines hard and soft skills to make a better understanding of the applications to the public target.
