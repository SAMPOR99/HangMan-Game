In technical writing is important to know your public target even if your writing is
quite technical or not, so the question is how can you identify who is your target? 
and what do they want,the best way to know is to answer some specific questions, 
questions like who your audience is? who your readers are going to be? which company
they are working in? what their role in that company are? what are their strengths 
and weeknesses and so on and so forth.

why do we need such kind of absurb questions? 
because no matter if our technical writing is perfect in the wrong hands, they will
not fully understand what are our purpose. there is an excellent definition of the 
phrase "good documentation": knowledge and abilities that your audience needs

there are in a vague way 4 kinds of types of audience.
experts: people who know the theory or product inside or outside.
technicals: those who build, operate, maintain and repair what experts design.
executives: people who take administrative, economic, or politic decisions
about the things which experts and technicals are working in.
non-technicals: people who simple are interested in technical topics despite of
their understanding or ability is not enough in such topics.

identify the type of audience and adjust the level of you writting will help you
to a better understanding and enjoyment of your audience.
